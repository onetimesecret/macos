## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Harvested from the parallel skeleton prototype (PR #5), adapted to
  this crate layout:
  - `companion-core`: `SecretBuffer` (page-locked via `mlock`, zeroized
    on drop, compile-time proofs it cannot be cloned, logged, or
    serialized) now backs every cell's content; `harden_process()`
    disables core dumps before any secret is held.
  - `companion-credentials`: the `CredentialStore` contract with a
    macOS Keychain implementation (`security-framework`, cfg-gated) and
    an in-memory dev fallback. The API token never lives in config.
  - `companion-ffi`: the C-ABI seam for a non-Rust shell — opaque
    handles and non-secret JSON only, with a test asserting plaintext
    never crosses. Adds what the prototype's seam lacked: copy-out (the
    core writes the pasteboard itself, transient/concealed-marked, with
    a change-count-guarded clear) and `next_deadline_ms` so the shell
    arms one timer instead of polling. The temporary plaintext-ingest
    dev shim is gated behind an off-by-default `dev-scaffolding`
    feature, so a normal build exports no entry point that moves
    plaintext across the seam. `scripts/build-core.sh` packages it as a
    universal `.xcframework` (`--dev-scaffolding` opts the spike in).
  - `spikes/swift-panel`: the Swift/AppKit arm of the ADR-0002 spike —
    menu-bar panel, non-activating edge-docked `NSPanel`, draining ring
    with Reduce Motion fallback and VoiceOver text equivalents — bound
    to the seam, awaiting the issue #4 hardware session.
  - CI: a full-history gitleaks secret-scan job. The binary is
    version-pinned and checksum-verified; intentionally fake test
    fixtures are allowlisted by exact fingerprint in `.gitleaksignore`,
    and PAT-shaped samples are assembled at runtime so no token-shaped
    literal sits in the source text.
- Repository skeleton per the spec's initialization prescription
  (docs/spec/07): Cargo workspace, CI lanes, ADR practice, governance
  files.
- `companion-core`: zeroizing cell store, TTL ladder
  (1h → 3h → 8h → 24h → 3d → 7d, default 8h), scheduled expiry (no
  polling), cap-refusal at twelve cells, conservative secret-shape
  heuristics, lifecycle states.
- `ots-client`: sans-IO client for the Onetime Secret v3 API — conceal
  (authenticated + guest routes), auth as a swappable strategy (HTTP
  Basic now, PASETO later), downward TTL snapping, share-link assembly.
- `companion-pasteboard`: the pasteboard hygiene contract
  (`ConcealedType`, transient marking, change-count-guarded
  clear-after-copy) with an in-memory implementation; the `NSPasteboard`
  adapter follows in milestone 2.
- A headless demo of the SleeperCell lifecycle:
  `cargo run -p companion-core --example demo`.
