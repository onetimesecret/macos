and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **The promotion flow** (issue #16, docs/spec/04) — the exit ramp, and
  the app's only network action. Two affordances: **↗** on a chip's
  hover actions and **↗ page** in the footer, both opening an inline,
  in-place confirmation (never a modal) with the destination named, the
  TTL seeded from the page's remaining time snapped *down* the ladder,
  and optional passphrase/recipient — the network boundary is the one
  confirming click. On success the share link is on the clipboard
  (written core-side, transient-marked), only the receipt id stays on
  the chip, and the confirmation offers **Burn local copy** (a chip
  leaves the document and zeroizes; a page closes into the ledger).
  Failure is inline with retry; content never leaves the sheet.
  - **The seam stays lawful**: `companion_chip_promote` /
    `companion_sheet_promote` move the sealed bytes core → `ots-client`
    → transport directly — they never enter Swift. Page promotion
    refuses image chips (the v3 payload is text-shaped, open question
    №3). The core mutex is released for the network round-trip, so a
    slow server never blocks a summon; both routes (and the Settings
    test) block their own thread and are called off the main actor.
  - **Connection config** (`companion_connection_configure` /
    `_json` / `_test`): server URL (refused unless `https://` — the
    TLS-only boundary enforced at config, not the socket), share
    domain, org `extid` as non-secret config; the **API token goes
    straight through the seam to the Keychain**
    (`companion-credentials`) and is never retained in config, echoed
    back in any JSON, or readable from the Settings UI again. Auth is
    Basic (extid + token) when configured, the guest conceal route
    otherwise — promotion works with zero setup against the default
    server.
  - **Settings → Connection** (right-click the menu-bar item): server
    URL, share domain, extid, a write-only token field, and a test
    button (`GET /api/v3/status`). Unlike the main window, Settings
    activates normally — deliberate act, needs the keyboard.
  - Tested sans-network: the conceal call is generic over the
    transport, so Rust unit tests drive it with a mock (auth route
    selection, guest fallback, TTL snapping, error shaping) and the
    Swift contract test covers config round-trip and offline refusals;
    CI never opens a socket, and the seam tests never write a real
    Keychain.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-13

The first tagged milestone. The rev C surface ran its first live
hardware session on real hardware: summoned, typed on, sealed, and —
confirmed by the session itself — excluded from capture (screenshots of
the window come out blank; the session had to be photographed with a
phone). Rough edges noted for follow-up; the core loop works.

### Added

- **The rev C window** (issue #12, docs/spec/04) — the shell sheds the
  spike's transitional docked list and becomes the window the spec
  describes: movable by its title bar, resizable from any edge,
  double-click-stretch to full working height, frame persisted across
  summons, still a non-activating accessory excluded from capture. One
  page shows at a time in an `NSTextView`-backed **ink editor**: typed
  ink, sealed chips as atomic inline attachments (arrows step over, one
  ⌫ removes whole — the sync mirror zeroizes core-side), markdown
  headings styled display-only with the markup kept visible. Bottom-edge
  Excel-anchored tabs carry live titles and per-tab gauges (dashed when
  held, hatched ember in the last hour), pause on double-click, close on
  ✕, drag to reorder; the dashed ◌ tab is the ledger — dead pages as
  dimmed read-only ink, tombstones struck through and labelled
  "zeroized". The keyboard map is complete: ⌥Space summon (Carbon
  hotkey, the app's one global claim), ⌘1–9, ⌘0, ⌥⌘←/→, ⌥⌘N, ⇧⌘V, ⌘↩,
  Esc hands the keyboard back (an ember border shows while the page
  holds it). Focus law unchanged: keys by deliberate act only.
- **Drop-to-seal is boundary-lawful**: `companion_sheet_seal_from_drag`
  reads the **drag pasteboard** core-side (`NSPasteboard(name: .drag)`,
  a new `SystemPasteboard::drag()` binding) while the drop handler is
  still inside the drag session — the shell hands over only the page id,
  no dropped byte transits Swift, the general clipboard is untouched.
  This closes the drag-ingest decision the hardware runbook had left
  open; what remains there is live-drag verification, not design.
- **The Rust↔Swift JSON contract test** (deferred from PR #11):
  `CoreContractTests` drives the live core through `CompanionClient` —
  sheet lifecycle, seal, document sync, title derivation, the pause, the
  ledger tombstone, the cap refusal — so a drifting field name fails in
  CI instead of rendering as an empty window. Deliberately avoids the
  pasteboard routes, so tests never touch a developer's real clipboard.

### Changed

- **The core speaks interaction-model rev C** (issue #10): sheets of
  ink and sealed chips replace the SleeperCell stack, and **detection
  is deleted outright** — `detect.rs`, `secret_shape`, `detected_as`,
  the concealed-hint plumbing, and every reference; masking is by
  gesture, never by content and never by origin. The new model:
  - `SheetStore`: up to **9 pages** (the keyboard wall; was 12 cells),
    refuse-don't-evict unchanged; drag-to-reorder; one **pausable
    countdown per page** (double-click holds 1h, again tops up to 24h
    from now — never cumulative; a hold freezes remaining life and
    lapses on its own, and cumulative held time is tracked for open
    question №8). Chips carry the **mechanical excerpt**, computed once
    at seal time (single line `min(24, ⌊n/3⌋)` split 60/40 head–tail;
    multi-line first line ≤17 chars + line count; images metadata-only
    — magic-byte sniff, never a decode, and excluded from `mlock` per
    doc 05). Tab titles derive core-side from the first typed line,
    heading markup stripped.
  - **The ledger**: dead pages (expired or closed) rest in a
    session-bound, read-only, newest-dozen record — dimmed ink plus
    chip tombstones (excerpt only; sealed bytes zeroized at death,
    exactly as before). Empty pages leave no record.
  - **The synced document**: the shell's editor owns live ink and
    mirrors its structure (`ink`/`chip` runs) into the core, which is
    authoritative for chip liveness — a snapshot that omits a chip
    zeroizes it (⌫ removes whole; undo never un-seals).
  - **The seam is rev C**: `companion_sheet_*` (new/close/move/
    cycle_rung/set_rung/pause_press/sync_document), the two seal routes
    — `companion_sheet_seal_from_pasteboard` (⇧⌘V: the core reads the
    board itself) and `companion_sheet_seal_text` (⌘↩: the seam's one
    deliberate plaintext-**in** entry — the argument is visible ink the
    shell already holds; the gesture moves it into custody) —
    `companion_chip_copy_out` (always transient + concealed) /
    `companion_chip_delete`, `companion_sheets_json` /
    `companion_ledger_json`, and `companion_next_event_ms`, which folds
    **pause-hold lapses** into the one armed timer (no polling,
    unchanged). `companion_ingest_pasteboard` and the
    `companion_cell_*` family are gone: a plain ⌘V is visible ink and
    never reaches the core. The boundary law is recorded in its rev C
    hard form — sealed bytes never reach the UI layer at all — and the
    boundary test now seals through every route and asserts the bytes
    appear in no output.
  - The shell is ported as a **transitional surface** (still the docked
    panel, now listing pages with their gauges, pause state, and the
    seal gestures); the real rev C window is the next slice. The demo
    REPL walks the full rev C lifecycle headless. ADR-0001's
    "rendering vs residence" consequence is annotated as superseded by
    the hard law; the hardware runbook carries a rev C note.
  - An adversarial review pass hardened the slice: `SystemClock` now
    anchors to a **sleep-inclusive OS clock** (`CLOCK_MONOTONIC` on
    Darwin, `CLOCK_BOOTTIME` on Linux), so countdowns and pause-holds
    keep draining while the machine sleeps — an 8h page no longer gains
    a weekend of life from a closed lid. Cycling or setting the rung of
    a due-but-unreaped page now refuses instead of resurrecting it
    (zero means zeroized, matching the pause's own refusal); the sealed
    paste zeroizes its transit copy of the clipboard string; page
    payloads preallocate exactly, so reallocation strands no sealed
    bytes in freed heap; and the Swift ⌘↩ wrapper refuses text with an
    interior NUL rather than sealing a silent truncation.
- **The shell graduated**: `spikes/swift-panel` is now `shell/`, per
  ADR-0002's consequences — the Swift package is unchanged apart from
  the xcframework path and its comments losing the spike framing.
  `spikes/tauri-panel` (and `spikes/` itself) is retired; the ADR
  preserves its measurements. CI gains a `shell (macos)` lane that
  builds the seam's universal xcframework (`scripts/build-core.sh
  --dev-scaffolding`) and runs `swift build && swift test` — the first
  time the Swift package is compiled by CI rather than by hand.

- **ADR-0002 accepted: the shell is Swift/AppKit** over the Rust core,
  across the C-ABI seam (ADR-0003). Decided on the two-way spike's
  evidence: native non-activating/drag semantics with no workarounds and
  22 MB idle vs. Tauri's bypassed visibility API, JS-side drag handling,
  and 61.6 MB (already over budget at 0 cells). The VoiceOver hardware
  runbook (docs/hardware-verification.md §B) stays open as verification;
  its failure modes are recorded as eject triggers, not gates.
  Consequences: swift-panel graduates to `shell/`, tauri-panel retires.

### Added

- Real pasteboard **ingest** across the C-ABI seam (issue #4): on macOS
  `companion_new` now binds the real `NSPasteboard.general` via the
  `SystemPasteboard` adapter (WS2) instead of the in-process stand-in, so
  the core reads the system clipboard itself — the shell asks, the core
  takes. Off macOS and in the FFI unit tests the in-process
  `MemoryPasteboard` stays, chosen once in `companion_new` behind an
  internal `Board` enum and invisible above the seam; the tests build a
  seeded in-memory handle directly so they never read or clobber a real
  clipboard. Verified end to end: a token-shaped string placed on the real
  clipboard with `pbcopy` is ingested, detected ("GitHub token"), masked
  in the summary JSON (`••••`), and the raw secret never appears — the
  boundary law holds through the live path. The `.xcframework` packaging
  and `swift build`/`swift test` remain to be run on a machine with full
  Xcode (this environment has Command Line Tools only); the Rust core
  builds clean in release for both Apple arches. See
  docs/adr/0003-binding-mechanism.md for the seam's binding decision.
- `spikes/tauri-panel`: the Tauri arm of the ADR-0002 two-way spike —
  Rust-native (links `companion-core`/`companion-pasteboard` directly, no
  C-ABI seam needed), non-activating edge-docked panel achieved by
  bypassing Tauri's own `show()`/`set_visible()` (which unconditionally
  calls `makeKeyAndOrderFront`) with a direct objc2 side-door onto the
  raw `NSWindow`; text-drag receiving via the WebKit/HTML5 DnD layer
  (Tauri's native `DragDropEvent` is file-paths-only); scheduled expiry
  via `tauri::async_runtime` + `tokio::time::sleep`; menu-bar tray icon.
  Verified non-activating via `lsappinfo` polling; measured 61.6 MB
  resident / 0.0% idle CPU across all 4 processes (main + 3 WebKit XPC
  helpers) — already over docs/spec/05's 60 MB Tauri budget at 0 cells.
  See docs/adr/0002-shell-selection.md for the full comparison against
  swift-panel (issue #3, workstream 1).
- `companion-transport`: `UreqTransport`, the one concrete HTTP
  transport this workspace ships for `ots-client` (`ureq` + `rustls`,
  default-features off — no gzip/cookies/charset). Refuses a non-`https`
  URL before any socket opens (the network boundary, docs/spec/05).
  `ots-client` itself stays sans-IO; this crate is the integrator's one
  choice, made once, here.
- `companion-core`'s demo gains `send`/`login`/`logout`: `send` performs
  a real `POST` through `UreqTransport` — authenticated (Keychain-or-dev
  credentials from `companion-credentials`, set via `login`) when
  available, the guest route otherwise — lands the returned share link
  on the clipboard (`SystemPasteboard` on macOS), and retains only the
  receipt id on the cell. `promote` is unchanged (still a dry run);
  `send` is the live path. Verified live against the guest route on
  `eu.onetimesecret.com`: a real secret was concealed, the share link
  round-tripped onto the real clipboard, only the receipt id was kept
  (issue #3, workstream 3 — closes the promotion loop end to end).
- `companion-pasteboard`: the real `NSPasteboard` adapter
  (`SystemPasteboard`, macOS-gated, `objc2`/`objc2-app-kit`), meeting the
  hygiene contract already tested against `MemoryPasteboard` — outbound
  writes carry `TransientType` always and `ConcealedType` when secret,
  inbound `ConcealedType` is reported, clear-after-copy is
  change-count-guarded. Verified against the real system clipboard: both
  marks land as written and are visible to any pasteboard observer
  (issue #3, workstream 2).
- Harvested from the parallel skeleton prototype (PR #5), adapted to
  this crate layout:
  - `companion-core`: `SecretBuffer` (page-locked via `mlock`, zeroized
    on drop, compile-time proofs it cannot be cloned, logged, or
    serialized) now backs every cell's content; `harden_process()`
    disables core dumps before any secret is held.
  - `companion-credentials`: the `CredentialStore` contract with a
    macOS Keychain implementation (`security-framework`, cfg-gated) and
    an in-memory dev fallback. The API token never lives in config.
  - `companion-ffi`: the C-ABI seam for a non-Rust shell — opaque
    handles and non-secret JSON only, with a test asserting plaintext
    never crosses. Adds what the prototype's seam lacked: copy-out (the
    core writes the pasteboard itself, transient/concealed-marked, with
    a change-count-guarded clear) and `next_deadline_ms` so the shell
    arms one timer instead of polling. The temporary plaintext-ingest
    dev shim is gated behind an off-by-default `dev-scaffolding`
    feature, so a normal build exports no entry point that moves
    plaintext across the seam. `scripts/build-core.sh` packages it as a
    universal `.xcframework` (`--dev-scaffolding` opts the spike in).
  - `spikes/swift-panel`: the Swift/AppKit arm of the ADR-0002 spike —
    menu-bar panel, non-activating edge-docked `NSPanel`
    (`sharingType = .none`), draining ring with Reduce Motion fallback
    and VoiceOver text equivalents, drag receiving via
    `.onDrop(of: [.plainText])`, bound to the seam through
    `PanelController` as the app's real entry point. Verified
    non-activating and measured (~22 MB idle, 0.0% CPU) via `lsappinfo`
    polling and `footprint`/`top` — see docs/adr/0002-shell-selection.md.
    VoiceOver operability itself awaits the issue #4 hardware session.
  - CI: a full-history gitleaks secret-scan job. The binary is
    version-pinned and checksum-verified; intentionally fake test
    fixtures are allowlisted by exact fingerprint in `.gitleaksignore`,
    and PAT-shaped samples are assembled at runtime so no token-shaped
    literal sits in the source text.
- Repository skeleton per the spec's initialization prescription
  (docs/spec/07): Cargo workspace, CI lanes, ADR practice, governance
  files.
- `companion-core`: zeroizing cell store, TTL ladder
  (1h → 3h → 8h → 24h → 3d → 7d, default 8h), scheduled expiry (no
  polling), cap-refusal at twelve cells, conservative secret-shape
  heuristics, lifecycle states.
- `ots-client`: sans-IO client for the Onetime Secret v3 API — conceal
  (authenticated + guest routes), auth as a swappable strategy (HTTP
  Basic now, PASETO later), downward TTL snapping, share-link assembly.
- `companion-pasteboard`: the pasteboard hygiene contract
  (`ConcealedType`, transient marking, change-count-guarded
  clear-after-copy) with an in-memory implementation for tests, the
  demo, and non-macOS hosts.
- A headless demo of the SleeperCell lifecycle:
  `cargo run -p companion-core --example demo`.
